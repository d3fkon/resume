# About Me #

I have a keen eye for detail and am good at learning new things as well as memorizing information. I've worked for a pro-gun political group and really like firearms. I worked at a call center for two and a half years and am good at communicating clearly and calmly, even if the customer is angry or frustrated. I really like learning new things and look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
